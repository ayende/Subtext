YUI Compressor 2.1.2, 2007-08-31
--------------------------------

+ Added --preserve-semi option
+ Modified --line-break option

YUI Compressor 2.1.1, 2007-08-30
--------------------------------

+ Fixed missing space in CSS background:url('foo.png')no-repeat
  causing a background not to appear on Internet Explorer.

YUI Compressor 2.1, 2007-08-29
------------------------------

+ Pass the --line-break option to the CSS compressor.
+ Allow the output file to overwrite the input file (with version 2.0,
  in this case, the output file was always empty)
+ Remove spaces before and after '(' and ')' as in background:url('xxx');
+ Merge (if possible) string literals that are appended in JavaScript files.
  This not only makes the code smaller, it makes the code faster,
  but allows you to maintain some readability in your source code.
+ Handle constructs such as a + ++ b or a + + "1" (in which case the
  space between the operators must be kept!) and other similar cases...
+ Pass ErrorReporter instance to the constructor of class JavaScriptCompressor
  (as suggested by David Bernard for his integration  of the YUI Compressor
  as a maven plugin)

YUI Compressor 2.0, 2007-08-27
------------------------------

+ Switched from Rhino 1.6R6 to Rhino 1.6R7
+ Integrated Isaac Schlueter's CSS compressor.
+ Refactored code to make it easier to use the compressor from a servlet
  environment or another Java app (no need to pass in file names anymore)
+ Output a white-space character after 'throw' only when necessary.
+ Output a white-space character after 'break' and 'continue' when followed
  by a label.

YUI Compressor 1.1, 2007-08-20
------------------------------

+ Java source now in package com.yahoo.platform.yui.compressor
+ Added --line-break option that adds a line feed character after each
  semi-colon character (may help debugging with the MS Script debugger)
+ Added support for missing JavaScript features (get, set, const)
+ Do not show the entire stack trace when the input file cannot be found.
+ Removed the randomization of obfuscated symbols. When compressed code is
  checked in CVS, unchanged files would otherwise end up being versioned.
+ Added web-based front-end to the YUI Compressor as part of the dist package.
+ Added a public entry point that makes the YUI Compressor easy to integrate
  with an already existing Java application.
+ Simplified code by using the same parsing routines used to build the symbol
  tree while looking for undeclared symbols.
+ Count how many times each identifier is used, and display a warning when an
  identifier seems to be unused (code cannot safely be removed automatically)
+ Remove ';' when followed by a '}'. This yields an additional ~1.5% savings
  on yahoo-dom-event.js compared to the JSMin version.
+ Output a white-space character after 'return' and 'case' only when necessary.
