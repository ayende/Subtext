Naked is a skin with a lot of class, but absolutely no style. It is basically a skeleton skin that contains all the controls with CSS selectors applied, but no formatting whatsoever. It is a great skin to start with if you want to build your own from scratch.

The overall page layout is a two column layout as follow

--------------------------------------
|            Header                  |
--------------------------------------
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
|                |                   |
--------------------------------------
|            Footer                  |
--------------------------------------

The middle columns contain the navigation pane (such as archive, blogroll, etc) and the main content pane (such as Category listings, Posts, etc). They can reside on either side.

Most controls have a main container with each internal element also having its own style. For example, the .post CSS selector surrounds each post, while the .title, .body, and .footer classes allow you to style those particular elements within the .post container.

The style.css class has all the elements and selectors predefined, simply add in the CSS stylings you want and *poof*..... instant skin!
