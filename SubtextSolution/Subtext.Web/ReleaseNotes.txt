Version 1.9.2 - Daedelus
-NEW: 	Removed some old skins and added some snazzy new ones.  
		We also implemented a way for custom skin definitions to not get overwritten when upgrading code.
-NEW:	Improvements to the packaged skins.  We added the Previous/Next control to nearly every skin 
		as well as Gravatar support among other minor improvements.
-NEW:	Comment Moderation!  This high demand feature was fast-tracked when my company was hired to 
		implement it for a client who wished to start a blog. The client agreed to contribute the 
		source back to the project!
-NEW:	Not exactly a new feature, but we changed the default Html Editor to use the FCKEditor.
-NEW:	Implemented RSD (Really Simple Discovery) and the MetaWeblog API’s newMediaObject method 
		so that Subtext works quite well with Windows Live Writer.
-CHG:	Subtext Providers have been refactored to use the Microsoft base Provider class, 
		System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.
-CHG:	Used Generics where appropriate.  As you know, there is a lot of temptation when given a new 
		hammer to start looking at everything as a nail.  We tried to avoid that temptation and make 
		judicious use of Generics.  I think we did a bang up job.  Most of our collection classes 
		are now generic collections and there’s that CollectionBook class I wrote about recently.
-CHG:	Improved our Continuous Integration and build process using CruiseControl.NET. 
		We now have a nice dashboard that provides a lot of visibility into our development progress.
-CHG:	Improved our unit test code coverage to 36.4% and counting. (When I started it was pretty much 0)
-CHG:	Subtext now runs under Medium Trust without problems except for the Trackback/Pingback issue.
-CHG:	Converted the Subtext.Web project into a Web Application Project.
-CHG:	Added a _System folder to the Skins directory. This contains some CSS files that any skin may 
		reference which provide some common CSS layout and styles.  For example, by referencing 
		commonstyle.css, you can use the pullout css class to pullout some text.  Custom skins can 
		reference these files and override specific settings, putting the Cascading back in CSS.
-BUG:	[1524172] The Username is being saved as the title.
