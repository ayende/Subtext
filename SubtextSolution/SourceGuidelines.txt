Code guidelines are typically a matter of religion.  However, we have to 
agree on something so here goes.

Our guidelines are online at:
http://subtextproject.com/CodingGuidelines/tabid/118/Default.aspx

Not that these are gospel, but they're as good a guideline as any.  If 
we get a tiny bit sloppy, that's fine. This is not a gestapo.  But please 
try to maintain the style of the existing project.

Also try to keep the FxCop warnings to a minimum.

3rd party assemblies should be placed in a folder named 
ExternalDependencies and added to the SVN repository as part of the 
VS.NET solution.  This way, a new developer should be able to get lastest 
and build the project without problems.

Please keep "bin" and "obj" folders as well as *.user and *.suo files OUT of 
SVN by making sure to use the SVN Ignore command.
